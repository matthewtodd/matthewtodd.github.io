I'd never gotten to feel an earthquake before, but yesterday late afternoon we had a big one! No damage to report, just a really weird, novel experience---the shaking felt like being near when the space shuttle takes off.

The <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqinthenews/2007/us2007exbe/">USGS report</a> says it measured 6.0. Holy cow!
