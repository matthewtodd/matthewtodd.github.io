        <p>Live at <a class="self"
          href="http://masifio.co.tz/">masifio.co.tz</a> since August 2010,
        this application receives about 50 orders each week of produce to be
        shipped from a farm in southern Tanzania to up-market hotels and safari
        lodges. It receives customer and product lists from Quickbooks and
        generates packing lists and invoices in return. As internet access is
        frustratingly slow, I've paid close attention to load times, keeping
        pages light and assets aggressively cached. Written in Rails, hosted on
        Heroku.</p>

          href="http://cards.amanikids.org/">cards.amanikids.org</a> each
        December, this site receives orders for greeting and gift cards,
        tracking inventory for multiple distributors and accepting payments by
        PayPal and JustGiving. Over the past 2 seasons, this app has handled
        hundreds of orders, representing over $20,000 raised for the Amani
        children. <a href="https://github.com/amanikids/cards">Written in

        <h1>Children's Database, Amani Children's Home</h1>
        <p>This application helps Amani's social workers manage their caseloads
        and schedule their visits to children's families in the hopes of
        reunification. From their workflows, it also displays overview
        statistics for management staff. <a

        Ubuntu system hosted samba shares and the children's database up until
        its replacement in late 2010 by Dropbox and Heroku. It also provided a
        number of iptables restrictions in an attempt to reduce Amani's
        satellite internet charges.</p>

        <h1>HeadsUp OS X Application</h1>
        <p><a href="http://matthewtodd.github.com/heads_up">HeadsUp</a> is a
        simple clone of GeekTool I wrote to explore OS X development &mdash;
        and because I found GeekTool's configuration far too distracting. The
        first version was in RubyCocoa; I've since rewritten it in Objective-C.
        I love HeadsUp for keeping my agenda on my desktop, but I can't seem to
        convince anyone else that it's awesome!</p>

        <h1>Deploying a Chef Server on Heroku</h1>
        <p>I dug into Chef's server code just enough to learn how to <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/skillet">Rack it up
          directly</a>. Along the way, I also wrote a minimal <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/hideabed">CouchDB clone in
          Rails</a> with a simple <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/doily">JavaScript
          interpreter</a>. Unfortunately, Chef clients are pretty HTTP-chatty,
        so using a remote Chef server doesn't yet make much sense in
        Tanzania.</p>

        <p>This application tracks inventories of various biological reagents
        in freezers around the world, along with their quality assurance
        histories. We had particular fun writing a Javascript employee-lookup
        widget backed by the company's LDAP directory and somehow managed to
        move through 2 ORMs and 3 web frameworks along the way. Written in
        Java, eventually with WebWork, Hibernate, and PicoContainer.</p>
